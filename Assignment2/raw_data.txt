The extracted course
info should be saved into file following the format below:

“course_id;;;course_title;;;image_100x100;;;headline;;;num_of_
subscribers;;;avg_rating;;;course_content_length”.
For each line in the raw_data.txt file, you can copy and paste it to Json Parser Online
to check the format. Each line contains more than one course. All the corresponding
attributes can be found in the text. You can use the library re or str methods to
extract the data. The course content length in the text is like “40.5 hours”. Only 40.5
need to be retrieved. The course data will be saved into the course.txt file.
